The project is about decoding RAW signal of a 6 digit "safe code" using DSP (Digital Signal Proccessing) Real-time decoding using C language and CCS v11.2 (Code Composer Studio V11.2).

DTMF signals work as a 2D array where each row and column are represented as a wave (for example first row which contains the numbers 1,2,3,A is represented as 697 HZ).
The point of the project is to decode the RAW signal AKA white noise and filter out any unnecessary noise and match the pairs of sine waves that represent the number pressed.

The RAW signal file is called "Safe_code6.h", I ran 8 Bandpass filters to filter out the noise and keep the required sine waves that represent the pressed number.

My proccessor was running at 300 MHZ and it had plenty of room for adding more features as well as it can be improved A LOT.
